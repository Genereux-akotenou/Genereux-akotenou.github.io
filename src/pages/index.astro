      description: "This project explores the use of Genomic Language Models (gLMs), inspired by Large Language Models (LLMs), to improve gene prediction and translation initiation site (TIS) identification in bacterial genomes. Using a transformer-based architecture (DNABERT), the model was fine-tuned on curated bacterial genome sequences to capture complex contextual dependencies within DNA. The two-stage framework first identifies coding sequences (CDS) and then refines the prediction by accurately locating TIS positions. Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional tools like Prodigal, showcasing the potential of LLM-inspired models in genomic annotation tasks.",
