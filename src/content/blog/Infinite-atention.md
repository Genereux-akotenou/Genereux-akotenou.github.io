title: "Failed Implementation: 'Leave No Context Behind, Infinite Context Transformers'"

description: >
  This article reflects on a failed but insightful attempt to implement the Infini-attention mechanism proposed in 'Leave No Context Behind,' focusing on the challenges of extending context length in Transformer models through memory-efficient mechanisms.

## Overview

This write-up documents an exploratory effort to implement the *Infini-attention* mechanism from the paper **"Leave No Context Behind: Efficient Infinite Context Transformers with Infini-attention."** While the attempt did not yield a working prototype, the process highlighted key design difficulties and implementation bottlenecks in adapting attention architectures to unbounded contexts.

## Source Code

You can find the code and notes from the implementation attempt on GitHub:

## Coming Soon

A follow-up article will dive into lessons learned, including challenges with chunkwise recurrent processing, memory state tracking, and stability in decoder-only models.
