## Introduction

The Transformer model, introduced by Vaswani et al. in "Attention Is All You Need," has revolutionized sequence-to-sequence learning by discarding recurrence and convolution in favor of an entirely attention-based mechanism. This blog post unpacks its Encoder-Decoder architecture, self-attention mechanism, and positional encodings.

## What Is the Encoder-Decoder Architecture?

At its core, the Transformer employs an Encoder-Decoder framework:

1. **Encoder**: Maps an input sequence to a set of continuous representations.
2. **Decoder**: Generates an output sequence from these representations.

Both stacks consist of multi-head self-attention layers and feed-forward neural networks, with residual connections and layer normalization.

## Self-Attention Mechanism

### Scaled Dot-Product Attention

The attention mechanism allows the model to weigh relationships between different parts of the sequence:

\[
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
\]

Here, \(Q\), \(K\), and \(V\) are matrices representing queries, keys, and values, while \(d_k\) is the dimension of the keys.

### Multi-Head Attention

Instead of performing a single attention operation, multi-head attention projects \(Q\), \(K\), and \(V\) into subspaces and computes attention in parallel, enabling the model to capture diverse relationships.

## Positional Encoding

Since the Transformer lacks recurrence, it incorporates positional encodings to provide sequence order information. These are added to input embeddings and defined using sinusoidal functions:

\[
PE(pos, 2i) = \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right), \quad PE(pos, 2i+1) = \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right)
\]

These encodings facilitate learning relative positional dependencies.

## Advantages of the Transformer

1. **Parallelization**: Unlike RNNs, self-attention allows parallel processing of sequence elements.
2. **Global Context**: Attention mechanisms directly model dependencies across entire sequences, regardless of distance.
3. **Efficiency**: Fewer sequential computations lead to faster training and inference.

## Applications

### Machine Translation

The Transformer achieves state-of-the-art results in tasks like English-to-German and English-to-French translation, outperforming prior recurrent and convolutional models.

### Beyond Text

Transformers have been adapted for image, video, and audio processing, showcasing their versatility.

## Conclusion

The Transformer architecture marked a paradigm shift in deep learning for sequences, enabling faster training, improved accuracy, and application to diverse domains. Its foundational principles of attention and positional encoding continue to inspire advancements in neural networks.
