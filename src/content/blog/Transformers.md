## Introduction

In 2017, a groundbreaking paper titled "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. introduced the Transformer architecture, revolutionizing the field of deep learning. This novel approach discarded traditional recurrent and convolutional neural networks in favor of a purely attention-based mechanism, leading to unprecedented performance in sequence modeling tasks.

## The Evolution of Sequence Modeling

Before Transformers, sequence modeling was dominated by:
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)

These architectures, while effective, suffered from:
- Sequential processing limitations
- Vanishing gradient problems
- Difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies

## Core Components of the Transformer

### 1. Encoder-Decoder Architecture

The Transformer employs a sophisticated Encoder-Decoder framework:

**Encoder Stack:**
- Processes input sequences
- Creates rich contextual representations
- Comprises multiple identical layers
- Each layer contains:
  - Multi-head self-attention
  - Position-wise feed-forward networks
  - Residual connections
  - Layer normalization

**Decoder Stack:**
- Generates output sequences
- Maintains causal attention
- Similar structure to encoder but with:
  - Masked multi-head attention
  - Encoder-decoder attention
  - Position-wise feed-forward networks

### 2. Self-Attention Mechanism

#### Scaled Dot-Product Attention

The attention mechanism is the heart of the Transformer:

\[
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
\]

Where:
- \(Q\): Query matrix
- \(K\): Key matrix
- \(V\): Value matrix
- \(d_k\): Dimension of keys

#### Multi-Head Attention

Multi-head attention enables the model to:
- Process different representation subspaces
- Capture various types of relationships
- Compute attention in parallel
- Enhance model capacity

### 3. Positional Encoding

Since Transformers lack recurrence, positional information is injected through sinusoidal encodings:

\[
PE(pos, 2i) = \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right)
\]
\[
PE(pos, 2i+1) = \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right)
\]

## Advanced Transformer Variants
