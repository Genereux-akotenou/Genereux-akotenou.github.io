# Temporal Difference (TD) Methods for Reinforcement Learning

Temporal Difference (TD) learning is a foundational model-free approach in reinforcement learning (RL) that merges concepts from Monte Carlo (MC) methods and Dynamic Programming (DP). It enables learning directly from experience without requiring a model of the environment.

---

## Key Features of TD Learning

1. **Model-Free**:
   - Like MC, TD learning does not require knowledge of the environment's dynamics.
   
2. **Bootstrapping**:
   - Updates value estimates using current estimates without waiting for the episode to end (as in DP).

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Unlike MC, TD methods can operate in environments with infinite horizons.

## Temporal Difference Prediction

### TD(0) - One-Step TD
- **Objective**: Estimate \( v_\pi(s) \), the state-value function.
- **Key Idea**:
  - Update state values incrementally based on a single time-step.
  - The TD error:
    \[
    \delta_t = r_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)
    \]
- **Update Rule**:
  \[
  V(S_t) \leftarrow V(S_t) + \alpha \delta_t
  \]
  where \( \alpha \) is the learning rate.

#### Algorithm
1. Initialize \( V(s) \) for all states.
2. For each episode:
   - Start at a random state \( S \).
   - Take action \( A \) and observe \( (S', R) \).
   - Update value:
     \[
     V(S) \leftarrow V(S) + \alpha [R + \gamma V(S') - V(S)]
     \]
   - Set \( S \leftarrow S' \).

---

### TD(1) - Full-Episode TD
- **Objective**: Update values after observing the entire episode.
- **Key Idea**:
  - Use the full return \( G_t \) for updates:
    \[
    G_t = r_{t+1} + \gamma r_{t+2} + \ldots + \gamma^{T-t-1} r_T
    \]
- **Update Rule**:
  \[
  V(S_t) \leftarrow V(S_t) + \alpha [G_t - V(S_t)]
  \]

#### Algorithm
1. Initialize \( V(s) \) for all states.
2. For each episode:
   - Record all state-action-reward sequences.
   - Compute returns for each state.
   - Update state values using:
     \[
     V(S_t) \leftarrow V(S_t) + \alpha [G_t - V(S_t)]
     \]

---

### n-Step TD
- **Objective**: Balance between TD(0) and TD(1) using an \( n \)-step return.
- **n-Step Return**:
  \[
  G_{t:t+n} = r_{t+1} + \gamma r_{t+2} + \ldots + \gamma^{n-1} r_{t+n} + \gamma^n V(S_{t+n})
  \]
- **Update Rule**:
  \[
  V(S_t) \leftarrow V(S_t) + \alpha [G_{t:t+n} - V(S_t)]
  \]

---

## TD(位) - Generalized TD
- Combines all \( n \)-step returns into a single weighted return.
- **位-Return**:
  \[
  G_t^\lambda = (1 - \lambda) \sum_{n=1}^\infty \lambda^{n-1} G_{t:t+n}
  \]
  where \( \lambda \in [0, 1] \) controls the weighting.

### Implementation Approaches

#### Forward View
- Uses future states to calculate \( G_t^\lambda \).
- Requires complete episodes for computation.

#### Backward View (Eligibility Traces)
- Updates values incrementally using eligibility traces:
  \[
  e_t(S) = \gamma \lambda e_{t-1}(S) + 1(S = S_t)
  \]
- Update Rule:
  \[
  V(S) \leftarrow V(S) + \alpha \delta_t e_t(S)
  \]

---

## Comparison of TD(位) with MC and TD(0)

1. **TD(0)**:
   - Uses only the immediate next state for updates.
2. **MC (TD(1))**:
   - Uses the full episode return for updates.
3. **TD(位)**:
   - Provides a balance by averaging across multiple time-steps with exponential weighting.

---

## Advantages of TD Learning

1. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Updates occur during the episode without waiting for it to finish.
2. **Versatile**:
   - Works in episodic and continuous environments.

---

## Applications
- **Real-Time Strategy Games**:
  - Adaptive learning of strategies based on partial episodes.
- **Autonomous Driving**:
  - Online updates for navigation policies in dynamic environments.

Temporal Difference methods are powerful tools in reinforcement learning, bridging the gap between Monte Carlo and Dynamic Programming approaches. With flexibility and efficiency, TD learning remains foundational in solving complex RL problems.
