# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a branch of machine learning that focuses on learning through interaction. It models human-like learning where actions are rewarded or punished, guiding behavior over time.

## Key Concepts

1. **Learning Through Interaction**:
   - RL mimics human learning via trial and error.
   - Agents learn by interacting with their environment and receiving feedback (rewards/punishments).

2. **Sequential Decision Making**:
   - RL deals with **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**.
   - An agent selects a sequence of actions to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

3. **Core Components**:
   - **Agent**: The decision-maker.
   - **Environment**: The external system with which the agent interacts.
   - **State (S)**: Representation of the current situation in the environment.
   - **Action (A)**: Possible choices the agent can make.
   - **Reward (R)**: Feedback signal indicating the desirability of an action.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Markov Decision Process (MDP)
An MDP is characterized by the tuple \( (S, A, P, R, \gamma) \):
- \( S \): Set of possible states.
- \( A \): Set of possible actions.
- \( P(s'|s, a) \): Transition probability from state \( s \) to \( s' \) given action \( a \).
- \( R(s, a) \): Reward function for taking action \( a \) in state \( s \).
- \( \gamma \): Discount factor (\( 0 \leq \gamma \leq 1 \)).

### Return and Discounted Return
- Total reward: \( G = \sum_{t=0}^{T} r_t \)
- Discounted return: 
  \[
  G_t = r_{t+1} + \gamma r_{t+2} + \gamma^2 r_{t+3} + \ldots = \sum_{k=t+1}^{T} \gamma^{k-t-1} r_k
  \]

### Bellman Equation
The Bellman equation relates the value of a state to the values of subsequent states:
\[
V(s) = \max_a \left[ R(s, a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s'|s, a) V(s') \right]
\]

## Learning Paradigms

1. **Supervised Learning**:
   - Maps inputs to outputs with labeled data.
   - Example: Image classification.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**:
   - Identifies patterns without predefined labels.
   - Example: Clustering.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Optimizes decisions based on feedback.
   - Example: Autonomous driving or game playing.

## Types of Policies
A policy defines the behavior of an agent:
- **Deterministic**: Maps a state to a specific action.
  \[
  \pi(s) = a
  \]
- **Stochastic**: Provides a probability distribution over actions.
  \[
  \pi(a|s) = P(A_t = a | S_t = s)
  \]

## Exploration vs. Exploitation
- **Exploration**: Trying new actions to discover their effects.
- **Exploitation**: Choosing actions known to yield high rewards.
- A balance between these strategies is crucial for optimal learning.

## Applications
- **Game playing**: Chess, Go.
- **Robotics**: Autonomous navigation.
- **Healthcare**: Treatment recommendation systems.

## Frameworks and Tools
- **OpenAI Gym**: A library for RL environments.
- **Baselines**: Implementations of RL algorithms.
